                    A dedicated Bangladeshi student, born and raised in the United Arab Emirates, seeking diverse experiences and committed to excellence in any role. Adaptable and attentive, with a passion for learning and growth. At 21, transitioning from a British high school to 42 Abu Dhabi amid COVID-19, I embarked on a coding journey with no prior experience. Over the past 8 months, I navigated complex projects and continue to serve as the 42 Abu Dhabi Robotics Club President, achieving milestones like creating a 3D-printed robot. Challenges in time management and C programming pushed me to develop resilience and efficiency. Proficient in C, Bash, and Git, I aim to enhance time management, creativity, and interpersonal skills while deepening my knowledge in C++. Short-term goals include completing the Minishell project and advancing through 42's curriculum, with aspirations to attend university abroad and represent the Robotics Club nationally and internationally during my time here as a student. Long-term goals encompass becoming a full-stack developer, delving into robotics, establishing a tech startup, mentoring, and continuous learning. Reflecting on my journey, I'm poised for the future, embracing opportunities with confidence shaped by challenges and triumphs.
